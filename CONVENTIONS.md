# Conventions — pd-prep-for-pgdp

## Rule: No comments explaining what code does

**The rule.** Don't add comments that restate what the code does;
well-named identifiers already do that. Only add a comment when the
WHY is non-obvious: a hidden constraint, a subtle invariant, or a
workaround for a specific bug.

**Why.** Comments rot when code changes and become misleading. The rule
also applies to docstrings — one short line max; no multi-paragraph
docstrings and no multi-line comment blocks.

**Common high-confidence violations** (bot auto-fix candidates)

- One-line summary comment immediately above a function that restates its name.
- `# returns the X` or `# sets the Y` before a return/assignment statement.
- Multi-line docstrings that explain every parameter with no non-obvious WHY.
- Section divider blocks: `# ---…---` / `# ===…===` multi-line banners used as
  navigation headers in test files — class names and blank lines already
  provide structure; remove the banner, keep the blank lines.
- Multi-paragraph module or class docstrings with a "Focus on:" / "Covers:"
  section — collapse to a single-line summary.

**Common judgment-call violations** (bot flags, CT decides)

- Comments that reference the PR, issue, or task that introduced the code — belongs in commit message, not source.
- Multi-line preamble that mixes WHY (worth keeping) with WHAT (worth removing).

## Rule: Unicode escape sequences for ruff-flagged ambiguous characters

**The rule.** Characters ruff flags under RUF001/002/003 (ambiguous Unicode —
curly quotes, en-dashes, em-dashes, multiplication signs, non-breaking spaces,
etc.) must be written as `\uXXXX` escape sequences in string and docstring
literals. In comments, replace with the plain ASCII equivalent. In every case
include a short inline comment naming the character, e.g.
`"""  # LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK`.

**Why.** Literal curly quotes and dashes are visually indistinguishable from
ASCII equivalents in most editors and diff views, making string comparisons and
grep silently fragile. Escape sequences make intent explicit and are safe across
all encodings. `# noqa: RUF00x` masks the problem instead of fixing it.

**Common high-confidence violations** (bot auto-fix candidates)

- A string literal containing `"hello – world"` written with the literal
  `–` character instead of the escape sequence.
- `# noqa: RUF001`, `# noqa: RUF002`, or `# noqa: RUF003` suppressions instead
  of escape sequences.
- `RUF002` or `RUF003` added to `[tool.ruff.lint] ignore` in `pyproject.toml`
  to paper over ambiguous characters.

**Common judgment-call violations** (bot flags, CT decides)

- Test strings that intentionally exercise curly-quote round-trip through the
  OCR pipeline and must contain the literal character — keep the literal with an
  explicit `# noqa: RUF001  # intentional: testing curly-quote round-trip`
  comment that names the character and states the reason.

## Rule: Use `uv run` for all Python and tool invocation

**The rule.** Invoke Python, pytest, ruff, mypy/pyright, and any project-local
CLI through `uv run`. Never call bare `python`, `python3`, `pytest`, or
`pre-commit` from a Makefile target, CI step, or hook.

**Why.** Direct invocation skips the project's `.venv` and the lockfile-pinned
toolchain; tests pass locally and fail in CI (or vice versa) because the bare
interpreter sees different installed package versions. `uv run` is uniformly
fast (<200 ms warm) and always selects the project venv.

**Common high-confidence violations** (bot auto-fix candidates)

- `python -m pytest` or `python3 script.py` in any `Makefile`, `*.sh`,
  `.github/workflows/*.yml`, or `.pre-commit-config.yaml` hook.
- `pre-commit run` (bare) instead of `uv run pre-commit run` in CI or scripts.
- `ruff check` or `pyright` (bare) in scripts that don't activate a venv first.

**Common judgment-call violations** (bot flags, CT decides)

- One-off REPL commands typed in CT's interactive shell — out of scope for this rule.
